# NoMoreBorder

NoMoreBorder is a utility designed to enhance your multitasking experience by enabling any windowed application to run in a fullscreen borderless mode without changing the screen resolution. This software is perfect for certain scenarios where applications don't have a dedicated full-screen borderless mode and running it fullscreen would mess up with dual screen behaviours.

## Features

1. **Borderless Fullscreen**: Make any windowed application run in fullscreen mode without the traditional window borders, providing an immersive experience without altering the screen resolution.
2. **Custom Resolution**: Have a big screen and an old game made for small screens and low resolutions where windowed mode is too small but fullscreen is so big you barely read the dialog? Now you can also set a custom resolution.
3. **Multiple Monitor Support**: Ability to select which monitor you want the window to be on.
4. **Reversible Action**: Easily revert any changes made to the window, restoring the original windowed mode with borders.
5. **Session Memory**: NoMoreBorder remembers which applications were set to borderless mode, automatically reapplying these settings in future sessions. It's done through a configuration file, ensuring a seamless experience even after restarting the software or your computer.
6. **Dark Mode**: Includes a built-in dark mode, allowing for an on-the-fly theme switch to reduce eye strain during late-night sessions.
7. **Start with Windows**: Now offers the option to auto start with your system, to save you a few clicks!
